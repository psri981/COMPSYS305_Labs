-- synthesizable up/down counter
-- Lab 2 Task 2

architecture behaviour of BCD_counter is
  signal next_q : integer;
  signal q      : integer;
begin

  pReg : process
  begin  -- process pReg
    wait until clk'event and clk = '1';
    if init = '1' then
      q <= 0;
    else
      q <= next_q;
    end if;
  end process pReg;

  pCount : process (direction, enable, q)
  begin  -- process pCount
    next_q <= q;

    if enable = '1' then
      if direction = '1' then
        next_q <= q + 1;

        if q = 9 then
          next_q <= 0;
        end if;

      else
        next_q <= q - 1;

        if q = 0 then
          next_q <= 9;
        end if;
